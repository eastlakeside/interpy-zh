# __slots__魔法

In Python every class can have instance attributes. By default Python uses a dict to store an object’s instance attributes. This is really helpful as it allows setting arbitrary new attributes at runtime.

However, for small classes with known attributes it might be a bottleneck. The dict wastes a lot of RAM. Python can’t just allocate a static amount of memory at object creation to store all the attributes. Therefore it sucks a lot of RAM if you create a lot of objects (I am talking in thousands and millions). Still there is a way to circumvent this issue. It involves the usage of __slots__ to tell Python not to use a dict, and only allocate space for a fixed set of attributes. Here is an example with and without __slots__:

Without __slots__:
```
class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self, name, identifier):
        self.name = name
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.set_up()
    # ...
```
With __slots__:
```
class MyClass(object):
    __slots__ = ['name', 'identifier']
    def __init__(self, name, identifier):
        self.name = name
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.set_up()
    # ...
```
The second piece of code will reduce the burden on your RAM. Some people have seen almost 40 to 50% reduction in RAM usage by using this technique.

On a sidenote, you might want to give PyPy a try. It does all of these optimizations by default.

Below you can see an example showing exact memory usage with and without __slots__ done in IPython thanks to https://github.com/ianozsvald/ipython_memory_usage
